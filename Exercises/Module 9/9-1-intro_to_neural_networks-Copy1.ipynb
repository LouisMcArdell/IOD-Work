Just like many of our past models, the model is trained using a loss function, which our model will attempt to minimize over iterations. Remember that a loss function is some function that takes in our predictions and the actual values and returns some sort of aggregate value that shows how accurate (or not) we were.\n",

    "Neural networks do this by establishing sets of neurons (known as hidden layers) that take in some sort of input(s), apply a weight, and pass that output onward. As we feed more data into the network, it adjusts those weights based on the output of the loss function, until we have highly trained and specific weights.\n",
